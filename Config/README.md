# Otter-ish - Config
My own configuration and alterations to Otter Browser

Everything in here is my personal builds and setups to make it easier for me to move between machines.

Feel free to download just about everything (and hopefully merge into main branch)

This is in no way affiliated with anything.

This segment:
 * Config - My own config-file to be more similar to how I set my up O12

A simple otter.conf
To use:
 1. Shut down otter
 2. Make a backup of your ~/.config/otter/otter.conf  
    cd ~/.config/otter/  
    cp otter.conf otter.conf.bkup
 3. Put the newly downloaded otter.conf in ~/.config/otter/otter.conf
 4. Start otter-browswer
