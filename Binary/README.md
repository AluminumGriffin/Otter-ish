# Otter-ish - Binary
My own configuration and alterations to Otter Browser

Everything in here is my personal builds and setups to make it easier for me to move between machines.

Feel free to download just about everything (and hopefully merge into main branch)

This is in no way affiliated with anything.

This segment:
* Binary - RPi3 build

Built for RPi3 somewhat close to default.

To install just download the deb and run:
sudo dpkg -i otter-browser_0.9.12.deb

It should show up in Menu - Internet - Otter Browser (might take a while, but shouldn't), it it doesn't show up fast enough just open a terminal and type otter-browser and hit enter
