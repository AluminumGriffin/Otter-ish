# Otter-ish
My own configuration and alterations to Otter Browser

Everything in here is my personal builds and setups to make it easier for me to move between machines.

Feel free to download just about everything (and hopefully merge into main branch)

This is in no way affiliated with anything.

The segments
 * Language - .qm and .ts files with additions (hotkeys mainly)
 * Binary - RPi3 build
 * Config - My own config-file to be more similar to how I set my up O12
